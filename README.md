# Java Spring Boot template project

This repository is a template project for Java Spring Boot applications. It consists of a three-tier structure:
- `model` : model classes, constraints, database mapping;
- `api` : business logic implemented in a series of controllers and services that persist model data.
- `web-rest-service` : endpoint implementation of a REST API.
